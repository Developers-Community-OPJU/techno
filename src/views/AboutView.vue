      About OP Jindal University
    </h1>
    <p>
      Founded by the Jindal Education and Welfare Society, OP Jindal University
      (OPJU) was set up to bring high quality education to its students based on
      a world class curriculum, the latest teaching methodology and committed
      faculty members. The multidisciplinary university aims to develop young
      professionals and future leaders who will not only power growth and
      development in the state, but also make a mark globally. At the core of
      the university's philosophy and approach lies the belief that students
      learn best when exposed to real world situations and when nurtured through
      enriching interactions with practitioners and professors. We at OPJU
      believe that every student has innate potential that can be unlocked
      through quality teaching and mentorship.

      ><br /><br />
      When OPJU was established 8 years ago in Punjipathra, Raigarh District it
      was the culmination of the dream of my father and the founding Chairman of
      OP Jindal Group, Shri O. P. Jindal. JSPL’s humble beginnings are rooted in
      the District of Raigarh, where it began as a small steel making operation
      in the early 1990’s and through the hard work and dedication of the
      founders and employees today boasts of a 3.6 MTPA steel plant, a 3400 MW
      Power plant in Tamnar – the first independent power producer, Nalwa Steel
      Works, Structural Steel Division, and OP Jindal Industrial Park,
      Punjipathra. For a community that means so much to the success of JSPL, it
      was our dream to start a University in the area as both a way to give back
      to the region, but more so, a deeply rooted commitment to educate the
      youth of the area, as only an educated youth can help the nation develop
      to its full potential. Started in 2008 as an engineering college, today I
      can proudly say that in a short span of only four years, OPJU has become a
      role model for institutions of higher education not only in Chhattisgarh,
      but in the entire nation of what can be achieved with the right
      motivations, vision, and programs focused on student outcomes, creating
      vast employment opportunities for the youth of our nation and guiding them
      along a path to becoming successful contributors to society. With OP
      Jindal Group’s deep commitment to nation building and focus on core
      industries of Steel, Mining, Power, and Construction, it is only befitting
      that OPJU’s vision of becoming the nation’s first private and only
      university to enhance the core sector capabilities is our commitment to
      the growth of the nation and realizing our collective dream of building
      the nation we can all be proud of. As the Patron of an institution of
      higher learning, I am humbled by the enormous faith the community has
      bestowed upon me and accept the challenge and the responsibility to build
      a socially responsible, equitable, and accessible institute we can all
      take pride in.
